### Why? ü§îüíñ
_We seek to contribute to the development of an agro-industrial revolution in Colombia that extends to the world, that makes life better for the farmer and for us, that allows us to eat better food, of better quality at a better price; where we can all share with others and receive from others their innovations, ready to implement._

### How? ü§∑üèΩü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
_We achieve this through open source, open access hardware, community software development._ So feel free to clone and implement, expand or modify, this helps us in our mission to make agriculture open for everyone and easier to automate.

### What? üìä
Maticas funds and materializes its cause through the sale and development of automated, open source hydroponic growing systems and open access hardware. And of course with donations.
